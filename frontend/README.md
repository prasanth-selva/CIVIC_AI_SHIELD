# Civic AI Shield - Frontend

This folder now contains a Next.js App Router application (migrated from Vite).

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The global animated globe background is mounted in `app/layout.tsx` and uses the component at `components/ui/wireframe-dotted-globe.tsx`.
- shadcn-style components live under `components/ui`.
